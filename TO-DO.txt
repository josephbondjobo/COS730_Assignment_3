1. Run "mvn clean install && mvn package" to install depdendencies and to package the applications
2. Run "java -jar target/Executions-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" to start-up the application. ATM this fails, but it needs to be fixed. Once this command runs perfectly, then the container will also start perfectly.
3. When you're ready to deploy, make sure that the DB host is set to "execution-db" and not localhost.
